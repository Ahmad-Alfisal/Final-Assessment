# Program description:

The program is a group of 25 drunk people and when they leave the bar they smell randomly, as happens in real life when a person loses his mind because of excessive drinking. During this period, they move around until every person reaches their house and takes a break and perhaps to complete their celebration on the second day.

 ## The model includes several files to be run as required which is it:
 
•	`drunk.py` It is a main model and contains running codes that link between framework and the raster file ‘drunk.plan’

•	`agentframework` It contains the important algorithms for running the main program and in it  is identified  the objects such as homes, agents, environment and pub and determines the X and Y.

•	`drunk.plan` It is a raster data and it can be said that it is the map of the location of the bar and the houses and can be shown from the main model as a map.

•	`output.txt` It contains the outputs data after running the program.

### How to run the program:

The program can be run by PowerShell and Command Prompt as follwing:

1- navigate to the project folder

2- type the command `python drunk.py`

### It can be run via the spider program as follow:

1- open the drunk.py file

2- press on the gear icon on the file upper corner

3- choose 'set console working directory'.

4- in the Ipython console write the command `%matplotlib qt`.

5- run the code from the green arrow.

### The aim of the model is:

It can be said that the goal of this program is to take into consideration the random attitudes and behaviours of drunken people and how ways can be found so that they can be helped to reach their homes, which leads to their presence outside the home that could endanger their lives or the lives of others to risk
